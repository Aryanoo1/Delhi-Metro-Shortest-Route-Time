## Delhi-Metro-Fare 
Delhi Metro Shortest Route and Time Calculator

# Description

The "Delhi Metro Shortest Route and Time Calculator" is a Java-based program designed to assist users in determining the Minimum Time and finding the Shortest Metro Route between any two stations on the Delhi Metro network. The program utilizes advanced algorithm i.e Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient time calculation and route finding. The underlying data structures, including graphs, maps and lists, enable the program to handle large sets of station data with optimized performance.

# Features

User Input: The program allows users to enter the name of the source and destination stations within the Delhi Metro network. This user-friendly interface makes it easy for commuters to access information.

Time Calculation: By utilizing the graph data structure and Dijkstra's algorithm, the program calculates the fare for the shortest route between the source and destination stations.

# Shortest Route Finding

Dijkstra's Algorithm: The program employs Dijkstra's algorithm to identify the shortest route between the input source and destination. This algorithm efficiently navigates the metro network while considering station connections and distances.
Graph Data Structure: The metro network's stations and connections are represented using a graph data structure. This structure allows efficient traversal and exploration of station connections, enabling accurate fare calculation and route determination.

User Interface: The program presents users with clear and concise information. It displays the minimum Time for the selected route and provides a step-by-step guide to follow the shortest path, including station names and interchange points.
